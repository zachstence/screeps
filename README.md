Future plans:
* Need some sort of a task queue so that multiple screeps don't pick the same task and then only some contribute before its completed
* Need to allow creeps to find more than just 1 energy source, and hold their pathing to it
* Need to build extensions, roads, and defenses
* Need to begin making more specialized creeps with a list of tasks they can perform
  * Will require more advanced logic for determining a creep's task
